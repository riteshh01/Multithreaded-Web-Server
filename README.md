# Multithreaded-Web-Server
Multithreaded HTTP Proxy Server

Three major goal of making this Project: 

1) To make a proxy server which took requests from the clients and send it to the server.

2) It was also multithreaded (concurrent), which means sever can handle at max 10 clients.

3) Also give the feature of cache, which stores the most frequent requests.
